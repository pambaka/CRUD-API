# Welcome to the CRUD-API

To start the server clone the repository with the `git clone` command, go to the repository folder, switch the branch with the `git checkout develop` command and run `npm install`.
If you want to use server port from `.env` file, rename `.env.example` to `.env`


Now you a ready to start the server:

`npm run start:dev` - development mode

`npm run start:prod` - production mode

`npm run strt:multi` - experimental mode :) with multiple running server instances, load-balancing and a shared in-memory database.

## With the CRUD-API app you can:

  - ***C***reate users with `POST` method *(use `/api/users` endpoint to add the user)*

  - ***R***ead data with `GET` method 
*(use `/api/users` *(to get all users)* and `/api/users/{uuid}` *(to get the user with {uuid} id)* endpoints)*

  - ***U***pdate data with `PUT` method *( use `/api/users/{uuid}` endpoint to update the user with {uuid} id)*

  - ***D***elete data with `DELETE` method *(use `/api/users/{uuid}` endpoint to delete the user with {uuid} id)*

Users are stored as `objects` with the following properties:
  - `id` — unique identifier (`string` in [`uuid`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html#name-uuid-format) format) generated by server
  - `username` — user's name (`string`, **required**) 
  - `age` — user's age (`number`, **required**)
  - `hobbies` — user's hobbies (`array` of `strings` or empty `array`, **required**)
    
For successful execution of `POST` and `PUT` commands all the **required** properties must be passed to the server with properly formatted values.



Happy testing :)
